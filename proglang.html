  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Machine Language</td>
    <td>a computer programming language consisting of binary or hexadecimal instructions which a computer can respond to directly.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Debugging</td>
    <td>the process of identifying and removing errors from computer hardware or software</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Assembler</td>
    <td>The Assembler is a Software that converts an assembly language code to machine code</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Assembly Language</td>
    <td>An assembly language is a programming language that communicates with the hardware of a computer directly</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Translator</td>
    <td>A translator is a program. that converts source code into object code</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Compiler</td>
    <td>a software tool that translates Python code written in high-level human-readable form into low-level machine code or bytecode that can be executed directly by a computer</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Interpreter</td>
    <td>A python interpreter is a computer program that converts each high-level program statement into machine code</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Cross-Platform Software</td>
    <td>Cross-platform software means a language can run equally on variety of platforms- Windows, Linux/UNIX, Macintosh, Supercomputers, Smart phones etc</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Natural Language</td>
    <td> a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with the interaction between humans and computers using natural language</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Formal Language</td>
    <td> a language designed for use in situations in which natural language is unsuitable, as for example in mathematics, logic, or computer programming</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Machine Independence</td>
    <td> Able to operate on many different types of equipment.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>High level programming language</td>
    <td> A high-level programming language has a significant abstraction from the details of computer operation. It is designed to be easily understood by humans and for this reason they must be translated by another software.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Object-oriented programming</td>
    <td> a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>scripting language</td>
    <td> A scripting language is a programming language that employs a high-level construct to interpret and execute one command at a time.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Data Types:</td>
    <td> Integer: a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.</td>
     <td>   Float: a function or reusable code in the Python programming language that converts values into floating point numbers.</td>
    <td> String: a collection of alphabets, words or other characters</td>
    
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Primitive data type</td>
    <td> These data structures contain simplified data values and serve as the foundation for manipulating data.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Data Strucutre</td>
    <td>a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Python Collection data structures:</td>
    <td> List: Lists are used to store data of different data types in a sequential manner..</td>
    <td> Tuple:Tuples are another standard sequence data type. The difference between tuples and list is that tuples are immutable, which means once defined you cannot delete</td>
    <td> Set: A set is a collection of unique elements with no defined order, which are utilized when an object only needs to exist within a collection of objects</td>
    <td> dictionary:  dictionaries (or dicts for short) are a central data structure</td>

    <td>a local variable is a variable that is given local scope</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Global variable</td>
    <td>a global variable is a variable with global scope, meaning that it is visible throughout the program, unless shadowed. The set of all global variables is known as the global environment or global state</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Source program</td>
    <td>an original computer program written by a programmer that is converted into the equivalent object program, written in machine language, by the compiler or assembler</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Object Program</td>
    <td>a computer program translated from the equivalent source program into machine language by the compiler or assembler.</td>
